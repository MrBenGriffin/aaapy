# Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson Algorithm in Python 

The Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm is an algorithm
for generating rational approximants to functions in the complex
plane. This repository contains a Python implementation of the
AAA algorithm along with some utilities for applying and working
with rational functions in the rational barycentric
representation.

This project is still in its infancy, so there may be bugs.
Please use with caution!
